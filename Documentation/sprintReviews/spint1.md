# Important decisions made for Sprint1
-For 1st sprint, Azure could not deploy due to depletion of artifact storage. It was believed that the repo had technical issues.
.It was decided that a separate personal repo should be used for deployment to keep track of tests.
.An option was available that the web app could be deployed manually on Azure which is not an effecient way for the purpose of Agile development.

-Instead of a server databasae, an array was used as a database for the first sprint. Developers were not fullly equipped with repect to database related issues.
.It was therefore agreed upon that SQL should be implemented for the next sprint.

-Due to loss of a group member, and one member not being able to complete their stories(due to illnesses);
.It was decided that more user stories should be assigned per member for the next sprint.

-It was decided that the current user stories in the product backlog should be further broken down into smaller stories so that it will be clear what the app should mainly do.

-On stories not completed/done in sprint 1;
.It was decided that these sprints should be carried over to the next sprint.
